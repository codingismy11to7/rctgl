Tim Miller's RCTGL

Many years ago my good friend Tim Miller (DarkHelmet on coasterbuzz.com, among other places) wrote RCTGL. I happened to
host his Subversion repository and his downloads.

Tim died suddenly and unexpectedly on September 9th, 2010. He was 33 years old.

I recently got a request asking for RCTGL. I have no idea what happened to the downloads I used to host. Fortunately, I
was able to find an old backup of an old backup of an old machine that used to host Subversion. After a lot of wrangling I
was able to import RCTGL code into a Git repository.

So here you are. I made a few commits years ago to get RCTGL in Visual Studio 2003, but I can't help you with this. I
didn't write it, I don't know how it works, I don't know how to build it, I don't have a Windows machine or Visual Studio,
etc. I don't know if anybody wants this source code (didn't a later version of RCT allow you to ride the rides and import
your old parks?), but here it is.
